 Nonstabilizerness, or magic, is a critical quantum resource that, together with entanglement, characterizes the non-classical complexity of quantum states. Here, we address the problem of quantifying the magic of Matrix Product States (MPS) with bond dimension $\chi$. 
 First, we show how Stabilizer Rényi Entropies (SRE) can be estimated by means of a simple perfect sampling of the MPS over the Pauli string configurations. Second, we consider random Matrix Product States (RMPS). We demonstrate that the 2-SRE converges to that of Haar random states as N/chi^2,
 where N is the system size. This indicates that MPS with a modest bond dimension are as magical as generic states. Finally, we introduce the ensemble of Clifford enhanced Matrix Product States (CMPS), built by the action of Clifford unitaries on RMPS. Leveraging our previous result, 
 we show that CMPS can approximate $4$-spherical designs with arbitrary accuracy. Our findings indicate that combining Clifford unitaries with polynomially complex tensor network states can generate highly non-trivial quantum states.

 Abstract

An important step in the compilation of a given quantum circuit on a given target device is qubit routing; the insertion of SWAP gates so that the required two-qubit gates can be performed on the hardware given the restricted qubit connectivity of that hardware. Noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers will be severely limited in their capabilities. This motivates the search for optimal SWAP strategies. This is at stake with the fact that finding the optimal SWAP strategy is NP hard. However, both A) quantum circuits for the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and B) hardware connectivity graphs, typically have a spatial periodic structure that can be exploited to make the problem tractable. I will present a method that does so and apply it to various circuits arising in quantum simulation. Assuming arbitrary two-qubit gates have unit depth, this leads to surprisingly low SWAP overheads. For example, the quantum circuit for the quantum simulation of the Heisenberg model on A), a square grid with nearest and next-nearest neighbour coupling, can be performed on B), a quantum computer with a square-grid coupling graph with C), no SWAP overhead at all.

I will describe a novel class of exactly solvable quantum unitary circuits on qudits. Their key feature is architecture that breaks 
parity and time reversal symmetries, while retaining the combined PT symmetry. A consequence of this chirality is a spin transport with 
a finite drift: the circuit acts as a quantum spin pump. The drift velocity is universal in that it depends only on the Casimir invariant of the 
local quantum spaces and survives non-integrable perturbations of the circuit. I will comment on connection to integrable Troterizations 
and, if time permits, discuss spin transport coefficients and hydrodynamics.

    The simulation of quantum systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm to perform digital quantum simulations of the BCS model on a quantum register with a star shaped connectivity map, as it is, e.g., featured by color centers in diamond. We show how to effectively translate the problem onto the quantum hardware and implement the algorithm using only the native interactions between the qubits. Furthermore we discuss the complexity of the circuit. We use the algorithm to simulate the dynamics of the BCS model by subjecting its mean-field ground state to a time-dependent perturbation. The quantum simulation algorithm is studied using a classical simulation.

    When simulating the time evolution of quantum many-body systems on a digital quantum computer, one faces the challenges of quantum noise and of the Trotter error due to time discretization. The Trotter error in integrable spin chains can be under control if the discrete time evolution preserves integrability. In this work we implement, on a real quantum computer and on classical simulators, the integrable Trotterization of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX spin chain. We study how quantum noise affects the time evolution of several conserved charges, and observe the decay of the expectation values. We in addition study the early time behaviors of the time evolution, which can potentially be used to benchmark quantum devices and algorithms in the future. We also provide an efficient method to generate the conserved charges at higher orders.

    The thermal or equilibrium ensemble is one of the most ubiquitous states of matter. For models comprised of many locally interacting quantum particles, it describes a wide range of physical situations, relevant to condensed matter physics, high energy physics, quantum chemistry and quantum computing, among others. We give a pedagogical overview of some of the most important universal features about the physics and complexity of these states, which have the locality of the Hamiltonian at its core. We focus on mathematically rigorous statements, many of them inspired by ideas and tools from quantum information theory. These include bounds on their correlations, the form of the subsystems, various statistical properties, and the performance of classical and quantum algorithms. We also include a summary of a few of the most important technical tools, as well as some self-contained proofs.

    Many quantum computing platforms have a restricted connectivity of their qubits, as captured by their connectivity graph. This poses a challenge for running algorithms that require a connectivity graph different from what the hardware can provide. Such algorithms arise naturally in the simulation of lattice-based spin models on quantum computers where there is a mismatch between the lattice to be simulated and the connectivity graph of the quantum hardware. To overcome this challenge and fully utilize the hardware, efficient qubit routing strategies are necessary. In this work, we present line-graph routing: a general method for qubit routing when the required connectivity graph of the algorithm is a line graph and the hardware connectivity graph is a heavy graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by routing circuits on kagome and shuriken lattices (including those needed for quantum simulation) to hardware with heavy-hex and heavy-square-octagon connectivity, respectively. Benchmarking shows the ability of line-graph routing to outperform established general-purpose methods. Our method has direct applications in the quantum simulation of lattice-based models and aids in the exploration of the capabilities of near-term quantum hardware.

    The intensive pursuit for quantum algorithms with speedup in terms of computational complexity has further led to this modernized crucial question: <em>When and how will quantum computers outperform classical computers?</em>. The next milestone in the context of this quantum transcendence is undoubtedly the realization of quantum acceleration in practical problems. Here we provide a clear evidence and arguments that the primary target is likely to be condensed matter physics. Our primary contributions are summarized as follows: 1) Proposal of systematic error/runtime analysis on state-of-the-art classical algorithm based on tensor networks; 2) Dedicated and high-resolution analysis on quantum resource performed at the level of executable logical instructions; 3) Clarification of quantum-classical crosspoint for ground-state simulation to be within runtime of hours using only a few hundreds of thousand physical qubits for 2d Heisenberg and 2d Fermi-Hubbard models. To our knowledge, we argue that condensed matter problems offer the earliest platform for demonstration of practical quantum advantage that is order-of-magnitude more feasible than ever known candidates, in terms of both qubit counts and total runtime.

    The ground state of the spin-1 Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT) model is a paradigmatic example of both a matrix product state and a symmetry-protected topological phase, and additionally holds promise as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation. Having a nonzero correlation length, the AKLT state cannot be exactly prepared by a constant-depth unitary circuit composed of local gates. In this talk, I will demonstrates that this no-go limit can be evaded by augmenting a constant-depth circuit with fusion measurements, such that the total preparation time is independent of system size. I will present experimental results collected on an IBM Quantum processor that indicate our measurement-assisted scheme outperforms purely unitary protocol. I will also demonstrate the utility of prepared AKLT states as "quantum wires" for teleportation. This work serves to provide an efficient strategy to prepare a specific resource in the form of the AKLT state and, more broadly, experimentally demonstrates the possibility for realizable improvement in state preparation afforded by measurement-based circuit depth reduction strategies on NISQ-era devices.

    The Algebraic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) is a highly successful analytical method used to exactly solve several physical models in both statistical mechanics and condensed-matter physics. Here we bring the ABA into unitary form, for its direct implementation on a quantum computer. This is achieved by distilling the non-unitary R matrices that make up the ABA into unitaries using the QR decomposition. Our algorithm is deterministic and works for both real and complex roots of the Bethe equations. We illustrate our method on the spin-12 XX and XXZ models. We show that using this approach one can efficiently prepare eigenstates of the XX model on a quantum computer with quantum resources that match previous state-of-the-art approaches. We run small-scale error-mitigated implementations on the IBM quantum computers, including the preparation of the ground state for the XX and XXZ models on 4 sites. Finally, we derive a new form of the Yang-Baxter equation using unitary matrices, and also verify it on a quantum computer.

    Simulating complex molecules and materials is an anticipated application of quantum devices. With the emergence of hardware designed to target strong quantum advantage in artificial tasks, we examine how the same hardware behaves in modeling physical problems of correlated electronic structure. We simulate static and dynamical electronic structure on a superconducting quantum processor derived from Google’s Sycamore architecture for two representative correlated electron problems: the nitrogenase iron-sulfur molecular clusters and α-ruthenium trichloride, a proximate spin-liquid material. To do so, we simplify the electronic structure into low-energy spin models that fit on the device. With extensive error mitigation and assistance from classical recompilation and simulated data, we achieve quantitatively meaningful results deploying about one fifth of the gate resources used in artificial quantum advantage experiments on a similar architecture. This increases to over half of the gate resources when choosing a model that suits the hardware. Our work serves to convert artificial measures of quantum advantage into a physically relevant setting.

    I will explain some recent works on constructing integrable quantum circuits using methods in statistical mechanics of lattice models, such as Yang-Baxter relation and star-triangle relation. I will demonstrate the construction using the renowned 6-vertex model and Potts model. I will present a proof of the recently conjectured integrability in so-called Potts circuits by Vladimir, Denis and their collaborators (Phys. Rev. B 105, 144306). The construction can be extended to what I call "Ashkin-Teller circuit'', which has not been studied previously.

    Estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. Gharibian and Le Gall (STOC 2022) recently introduced the guided local Hamiltonian problem (GLH), which is a variant of the local Hamiltonian problem (LH), where a classical approximation of a ground state is given as an additional input. Whilst LH is known to be QMA-complete (and therefore also ‘hard’ even with quantum computers), Gharibian and Le Gall showed that GLH with 6-local Hamiltonians is BQP-complete when the guiding vector has fidelity (inverse-polynomially) close to 1/2 with a ground state – meaning that in this setting we have a worst-case quantum advantage. For this talk I will introduce the GLH problem, argue why it is relevant, and share some results from a recent work in which we optimally improve both the locality and the overlap parameters, as well as extend the hardness results to the setting of excited states.

  <div class="card card-body">
    Simulation of materials is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. On near-term hardware the crucial constraint on these simulations is circuit depth. Many quantum simulation algorithms rely on a layer of unitary evolutions generated by each term in a Hamiltonian. This appears in time-dynamics as a single Trotter step, and in variational quantum eigensolvers under the Hamiltonian variational ansatz as a single ansatz layer. We present a new quantum algorithm design for materials modelling where the depth of a layer is independent of the system size. This design takes advantage of the locality of materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding that preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and present a compiler that transforms density functional theory data into quantum circuit instructions -- connecting the physics of the material to the simulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple levels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of the specific target material. We present numerical results for materials spanning a wide structural and technological range. Our results demonstrate a reduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard prior methods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian. For example our results improve resource requirements for Strontium Vanadate (SrVO3) from 864 to 180 qubits for a 3×3×3 lattice, and the circuit depth of a single Trotter or variational layer from 7.5×108 to depth 730. Although this is still beyond current hardware, our results show that materials simulation may be feasible on quantum computers without necessarily requiring scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers, provided quantum algorithm design incorporates understanding of the materials and applications.
